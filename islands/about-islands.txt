## Island Compositions

### Island 5 (20x20)
Created as a larger island with the following composition:
- Water (0): Random placement on rim hexes only
- Grass (1): ~70% of total hexes - primary walkable terrain
- Trees (2): ~20% of total hexes - scattered throughout for decoration
- Houses (3): 3 specific grass hexes converted to houses
- Stones (4): ~10% of total hexes - scattered for variety

Note: Only grass tiles (1) are walkable for player movement. All other terrain types block movement but provide visual variety to the island.
